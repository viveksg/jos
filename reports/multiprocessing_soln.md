1. the kernel is loaded at virtual address 0xf0100000 and physical addresss 0x00100000. Since mpentery_start is part of kernel it is loaded at address 0xf01059e0. But mpentry is supposed to executed at address  0x7000 i.e MPENTRY_PADDR. So macro MPBOOTPHYS loads all the required datastruture above 0x7000 by taking offset of instruction from mpentry_start. The low address is happening because mpentry_start is executed in real mode. If MPBOOTSYS macro is not used the code will be loaded at high address while there is np page translation support.
